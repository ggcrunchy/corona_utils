corona_utils
============

Assorted utility modules built atop Corona SDK.

These will be borrowed from [Corona SDK snippets](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona-sdk-snippets) and some (currently
private) projects. This is intended to be used as a submodule, i.e. actually removing the code from those very projects, with the aim of easier maintenance.
