solar2d_utils
=============

Assorted utility modules built atop Solar2D.

These will be borrowed from [Solar2D snippets](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/solar2d-snippets) and some (currently
private) projects. This is intended to be used as a submodule, i.e. actually removing the code from those very projects, with the aim of easier maintenance.
